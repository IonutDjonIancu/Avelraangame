Instead of being worn upright (hilt-high), it is worn horizontally, with the hilt and tip pointing up. It is normally used for slashing unarmored opponents either on foot or mounted; while the tip could be used for thrusting, the drastic curvature of blade made accuracy more difficult. It has an offset pommel, and its two lengthy quillons form a simple crossguard. The tang of the blade is covered by slabs of bone, ivory, wood, or other material fastened by pins or rivets to form the grip. This type of sword is famously used by Calvinian soldiers.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":false,"Sheet":{"Stats":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":0,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0},"Assets":{"Resolve":0,"Harm":29,"Spot":0,"Defense":0,"Purge":0,"Mana":0},"Skills":{"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":0,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":0,"Sail":0}},"Value":38},{"Identity":{"Id":"0b9254b8-05e9-4aec-ac57-ee7b91cbd2cd","CharacterId":""},"Name":"Battered normaund shield","Level":1,"LevelName":"Common","Type":"Protection","Subtype":"Shield","Quality":"Battered","Category":"Normaund shield","Subcategory":"Onehanded","InventoryLocations":["Mainhand","Offhand"],"Description":"A large, almond-shaped shield rounded at the top and curving down to a point or rounded point at the bottom. This shield is developed for mounted cavalry, and its dimensions correlate to the approximate space between a horse's neck and its rider's thigh. To compensate for their awkward nature, these shields are equipped with enarmes, which grip the shield tightly to the arm and facilitate keeping it in place even when a knight relaxes their arm; this was a significant departure from most earlier circular shields, which possessed only a single handle. Some examples are apparently also fitted with an additional guige strap that allowed the shield to be slung over one shoulder when not in use.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":false,"Sheet":{"Stats":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":0,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0},"Assets":{"Resolve":0,"Harm":0,"Spot":0,"Defense":10,"Purge":0,"Mana":0},"Skills":{"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":0,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":0,"Sail":0}},"Value":80},{"Identity":{"Id":"7987fa6d-ca5d-4762-89c2-d1ed8f8bb6c5","CharacterId":""},"Name":"Ordinary buckler","Level":1,"LevelName":"Common","Type":"Protection","Subtype":"Shield","Quality":"Ordinary","Category":"Buckler","Subcategory":"Onehanded","InventoryLocations":["Mainhand","Offhand"],"Description":"A small in size, round and usually made of metal kind of shield.
