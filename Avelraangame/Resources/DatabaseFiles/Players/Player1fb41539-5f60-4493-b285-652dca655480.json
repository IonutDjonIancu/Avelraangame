The strips connect three to six steel or bronze plates. The frame takes a conical design that curves with the shape of the head and culminates in a point. The front of the helmet may include a nose protector (a nasal). Older spangenhelms often include cheek flaps made from metal or leather. Spangenhelms may incorporate mail as neck protection, thus forming a partial aventail. Some spangenhelms include eye protection in a shape that resembles modern eyeglass frames. Other spangenhelms include a full face mask, as is ubiquitous with the Paladins of Seracleea.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":true,"Doll":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":0,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":26,"Stamina":0,"Harm":0,"Armour":15,"Purge":-6,"Health":0,"Mana":24,"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":12,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":0,"Sail":0},"Value":150},{"Id":"82c62a5c-ce04-4b63-b43b-a5fed2382d89","CharacterId":"","Name":"Low quality short bow","Level":1,"LevelName":"Common","Type":"Weapon","Subtype":"Bow","Quality":"Low quality","Category":"Short bow","Description":"A traditional composite bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together, a form of laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the outer side of a wooden core. When the bow is drawn, the sinew (stretched on the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. More powerful than the longbow, they can also retain a much higher degree of accuracy and a faster reload rate. Mostly employed by mounted archers and steppe people, they have been used extensively to stop Kardah or Calvinian expansions in the West Endari steppes.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":true,"Doll":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":15,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0,"Stamina":0,"Harm":28,"Armour":0,"Purge":-19,"Health":0,"Mana":0,"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":-3,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":2,"Sail":0},"Value":32},{"Id":"5f767637-b27d-41f2-a009-2bd62b426f26","CharacterId":"","Name":"Improvised azaga","Level":1,"LevelName":"Common","Type":"Weapon","Subtype":"Spear","Quality":"Improvised","Category":"Azaga","Description":"A pole weapon used for throwing, usually a light spear or javelin made up of a wooden handle and an iron tip.
