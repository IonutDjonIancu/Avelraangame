This shape distributes the weight in such a way that the falcata is capable of delivering a blow with the momentum of an axe, while maintaining the longer cutting edge of a sword and some facility to execute a thrust. The grip is typically hook-shaped, the end often stylized in the shape of a horse or a bird.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":true,"Doll":{"Strength":6,"Constitution":0,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0,"Stamina":0,"Harm":6,"Armour":0,"Purge":-15,"Health":19,"Mana":0,"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":-17,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":5,"Sail":0},"Value":12},{"Identity":{"Id":"067e028c-aaff-40d3-9df2-cae7d06769a7","CharacterId":""},"Name":"Dead weight norse axe","Level":1,"LevelName":"Common","Type":"Weapon","Subtype":"Axe","Quality":"Dead weight","Category":"Norse axe","Description":"A long-handled weapon with a large flat blade, often attributed to the Norsemen of Darkyrdom and Hyperborea. The blade itself is reasonably light and forged very thin, making it superb for cutting, nonetheless it also has pronounced horns at both the toe and heel of the bit, having the toe of the bit swept forward for superior shearing capability. Some also feature a brass haft cap, often richly decorated, which presumably serves to keep the head of the weapon secure on the haft, as well as protecting the end of the haft from the rigours of battle. Ash and oak are the most likely materials for the haft, as they have always been the primary materials used for polearms by the peoples of Varga's Stand.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":true,"Doll":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":33,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0,"Stamina":0,"Harm":12,"Armour":0,"Purge":-13,"Health":0,"Mana":2,"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":-12,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":14,"Travel":0,"Sail":0},"Value":24}],"IsAlive":true}]}
