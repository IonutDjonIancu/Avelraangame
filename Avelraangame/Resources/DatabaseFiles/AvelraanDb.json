Instead of being worn upright (hilt-high), it is worn horizontally, with the hilt and tip pointing up.

It has an offset pommel, and its two lengthy quillons form a simple crossguard. The tang of the blade is covered by slabs of bone, ivory, wood, or other material fastened by pins or rivets to form the grip. This type of sword is famously used by Calvinian soldiers.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":false,"Doll":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":0,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0,"Stamina":0,"Harm":13,"Armour":0,"Purge":0,"Health":0,"Mana":0,"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":0,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":0,"Sail":0},"Value":14}],"IsAlive":true},{"Identity":{"Id":"986b3cdf-6639-4988-8d97-743d5a5b7de4","PlayerId":"1fb41539-5f60-4493-b285-652dca655480"},"Info":{"Name":"The danarian","EntityLevel":1,"Race":"Human","Culture":"Danarian","Tradition":"Ravanon","Class":"Spellcaster","Fame":"Known as the Danarian","Wealth":126,"DateOfBirth":"2/18/2023"},"HasLevelUp":false,"LevelUp":{"StatPoints":0,"SkillPoints":0},"Doll":{"Strength":5,"Constitution":9,"Agility":7,"Willpower":11,"Perception":6,"Abstract":8,"Stamina":0,"Harm":0,"Armour":0,"Purge":0,"Health":0,"Mana":0,"Combat":22,"Arcane":9,"Psionics":0,"Hide":-10,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":4,"Apothecary":4,"Travel":10,"Sail":-30},"Traits":[],"Inventory":{"Head":null,"Body":null,"Mainhand":null,"Offhand":null,"Ranged":null,"Serviceweapon":null,"Heraldry":[],"AllItems":[null,null,null,null,null,null]},"Supplies":[{"Id":"7a1c7d03-78a2-46a5-8291-b2b086085b70","CharacterId":"","Name":"Low quality jewelry","Level":1,"LevelName":"Common","Type":"Wealth","Subtype":"Trinket","Quality":"Low quality","Category":"Jewelry","Description":"A small ornament or item of jewellery that is of little value.","Lore":"Not much can be said about this item.","HasTaint":false,"Doll":{"Strength":0,"Constitution":0,"Agility":0,"Willpower":0,"Perception":0,"Abstract":0,"Stamina":0,"Harm":0,"Armour":0,"Purge":0,"Health":0,"Mana":0,"Combat":0,"Arcane":0,"Psionics":0,"Hide":0,"Traps":0,"Tactics":0,"Social":0,"Apothecary":0,"Travel":0,"Sail":0},"Value":14},{"Id":"dcf0afaf-4a44-4e41-b21a-b962c24f12a0","CharacterId":"","Name":"Gracious warhammer","Level":2,"LevelName":"Refined","Type":"Weapon","Subtype":"Mace","Quality":"Gracious","Category":"Warhammer","Description":"A war hammer consists of a handle and a head.
